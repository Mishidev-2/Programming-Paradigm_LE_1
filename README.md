Idea + Story + Dialogue - Shimizu
Text Formatting - Shimizu + Gemini Pro, Calmerin (Mission 4), Cangaida (Mission 3)

General Framework + the Code - Shimizu

Only used Gemini pro for text formatting + some methods I couldnt figure out such as
    GameTools.textType();
    GameTools.displayGlitchEffect();
    GameTools.runMazeGame();

VS's Github copilot (i think thats what it was) suggestions were used sometimes to make the code more efficient
But the majority of the code and logic were by me (Shimizu)


Thank you...

How to run the game
> Open it up, wait for everything to load and run the MainFile





About the game:

This has a complete story mode - pretty long, so for quicker progression - set this:

 // Default speed (30ms)
   public static void typeText(String text) {
      typeText(text, 30); //<- set this to 1
   }

Game has a few gimmicks:
Yes or No Choices
Choice system that increments a counter
Riddles
Maze

It has 6 endings

Bad End 2 - Happens if you give the feather to the angel encased in ice

Good End - No feather + no sin

True Good End - Has feather + no sin

Bad End - No feather + sin higher than 0

True Bad End - Has feather + sin higher than 0

True Ending - Requirement: True Bad End
