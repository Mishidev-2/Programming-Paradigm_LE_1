Text Formatting - Shimizu + Gemini Pro, Calmerin (Mission 4), Cangaida (Mission 3)

General Framework + the Code - Shimizu

Only used Gemini pro for text formatting + some methods I couldnt figure out such as
    GameTools.textType();
    GameTools.displayGlitchEffect();
    GameTools.runMazeGame();

VS's Github copilot (i think thats what it was) suggestions were used sometimes to make the code more efficient
But the majority of the code and logic were by me (Shimizu)


Thank you...
