"A conduit of divine energy... Now a back door for wayward souls."

Remembering the statement said by the angel in chains, you tell yourself: 

"Truly an accurate description"

"Perfection admits no variation."

Before you, a source of light brighter than the sun radiates - but this is no celestial body made of mere gas, this is no simple amalgamation of liquid metal and gravity.

This is an Archangel - the highest order under the Throne.

The voice was never a guide. It was a calibrator - It was Metatron.

The gateway doesn’t just close; it hardens.
You aren't pulled forward; you are frozen in place, pinned by the sudden, crushing weight of absolute Law.

The Voice - Metatron looms, not as a spirit, but as a towering wall of judgment. He looks at you not with anger, but with the indifference of someone forced to correct a recurring mistake.

<METATRON - THE VOICE OF GOD>

"You attempted to enter the Equation while carrying a remainder. That is your sin. You are not evil; you are incorrect."

The floor beneath you dissolves. Opening into a deep, colorless expanse.
It is not dark; it is the terrifying absence of data - nihility.

"We do not abide paradoxes here. Your will has deviated from the Pattern. To keep the structure sound, the anomaly must be resolved."

He extends a hand, and gravity inverts. You are no longer falling down; you are falling backward - reverting to a state before you made your choices.

"I sentence you to the Null. Not to die, but to be unmade. Let the silence strip away your flaws until you are nothing but potential again.

"When you return, you will be symmetrical. Or you will not be at all."
