/* 
Unknown Demon: 
"Behold the Arbor Lucis."

"This fruit purges corruption, a reset for tainted existence. I am Mephis, its curator.

Mephis shifts his gaze to you... 
No.
Inside of you.

<Mephis:> 
"You are running on corrupted logic. I see the fatal error pulsing beneath your skin..."

"If only there were a debugger for such a primitive model. Oh, wait."

He produces the fruit, holding it out carelessly.

"THIS clears the crash. A factory reset. It is **sufficient** to keep you functioning."

He then holds up the feather, his eyes narrowing intensely.

"But this is the _update_. You could walk away merely 'repaired,' remaining the glitch you are... but why choose to be obsolete when you can be rewritten?"

I won't reset you only to leave you obsolete. 

So, choose: accept both the upgrade and the purge to continue, or refuse and let the corruption terminate you."
